# StockSimulatorPreview

By: Nathan, Jose, Terry 

StockSimulator is a stock trading platform that was developed as the final project of CS 346: Application Development at the University of Waterloo. StockSimulator allows users to simulate real-time stock trading, track market data, view friends' investing portfolios, recommend stocks to buy, and manage virtual portfolios. This project was developed with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) and incorporates Socket.IO for real-time price updates. It received a final mark of 100%, which was the maximum possible mark the project could have received. Our source code is available upon request, but it is not open to the public due to Policy 71 at the University of Waterloo.

Here is a preview GIF of the website:
